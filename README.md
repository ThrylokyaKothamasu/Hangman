Hangman Game

A simple yet engaging Hangman game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Choose a category, guess the hidden word, and save the man from being hanged!

Overview
Hangman is a classic word guessing game. This project offers a modern take on the game, allowing users to select categories such as animals, countries, and fruits. Each round, a random word from the chosen category is selected, and players must guess the word letter by letter before the hangman is fully drawn.

Features
- Category Selection: Choose from three categories: animals, countries, and fruits.
- Random Word Generation: Words are randomly selected to keep the game challenging.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface with intuitive controls.

How to Play
1. Select a Category: Click on one of the categories (animals, countries, or fruits).
2. Guess the Word: A random word from the selected category will be hidden as a series of blanks.
3. Make Guesses: Click on the letters or type them using your keyboard to make guesses.
4. Reveal or Hang: Correct guesses will reveal the letters in the word. Incorrect guesses will add parts to the hangman drawing.
5. Win or Lose: Guess the word before the drawing is complete to win. If the drawing completes, you lose.
